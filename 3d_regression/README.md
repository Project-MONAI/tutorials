3D Regression
=============

This directory contains a tutorial demonstrating how to use MONAI for 3D regression tasks, specifically brain age prediction using the IXI dataset and a DenseNet3D architecture.

## Tutorial Overview

The `densenet_training_array.ipynb` notebook provides an end-to-end example of:
- Loading and preprocessing 3D brain MRI data
- Setting up data transforms for regression tasks
- Training a DenseNet3D model for age prediction
- Evaluating model performance on test data

## How to Run

This notebook can be run locally with Jupyter or in Google Colab. The notebook includes all necessary setup instructions and dependency installations.
