# Description
Load the pre-trained weights from a MONAI bundle and execute the transfer-learning in a typical PyTorch training program based on it.

# Overview
This tutorial shows how to load a pretrained U-net from a MONAI bundle and train it on BTCV dataset using pytorch. The pretrained U-net was trained on volumetric (3D) segmentation of CT spleen from MSD dataset.

## Data
The description of data and data preparation can be found in [adapt_bundle_to_another_dataset](../adapt_bundle_to_another_dataset)

## Pretrained model
The pretrained model is from MONAI spleen_ct_segmentation bundle.
It was trained using the runner-up [1] awarded pipeline of the "Medical Segmentation Decathlon Challenge 2018" using the UNet architecture [2] with 32 training images and 9 validation images.

It can automatically download the bundle and load the model with the following code, which can be found in `train.py`.
```
import monai
pretrained_model = monai.bundle.load(
    name="spleen_ct_segmentation", bundle_dir="./"
)
model.load_state_dict(pretrained_model)
```

## Training configuration
The training was performed with at least 12GB-memory GPUs.
During training, 19 out of the 24 scans are used for training, while the rest 5 is used for validation and model selection.

Actual Model Input: 96 x 96 x 96

## Input and output formats
Input: 1 channel CT image

Output: 2 channels: Label 1: spleen; Label 0: everything else

## Scores
This model achieves the following Dice score on the validation data:

When training with BTCV data from scratch, we got mean Dice = 0.9294.
When finetuning with BTCV data from the pretrained model, we got mean Dice = 0.9488

The Dice of finetuning result is better than training from scratch for every subject in the validation set.

## Commands example
Train and evaluate from scratch:
```
python3 train.py
python3 evaluate.py
```

Load pre-trained model and do transfer learning:
```
python3 train.py --load_pretrained_ckpt
python3 evaluate.py --load_pretrained_ckpt
```
