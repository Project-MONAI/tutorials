# MONAI Tutorials
This repository hosts the MONAI tutorials.

### 1. Requirements
Most of the examples and tutorials require
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

These can be installed with:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
python -m pip install -U notebook
```

Some of the examples may require optional dependencies. In case of any optional import errors,
please install the relevant packages according to MONAI's [installation guide](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/installation.html).
Or install all optional requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/dev/requirements-dev.txt
```

#### Run the notebooks from Colab

Most of the Jupyter Notebooks have an "Open in Colab" button.
Please right-click on the button, and select "Open Link in New Tab" to start a Colab page with the corresponding notebook content.

To use GPU resources through Colab, please remember to change the runtime type to `GPU`:

1. From the `Runtime` menu select `Change runtime type`
1. Choose `GPU` from the drop-down menu
1. Click `SAVE`
This will reset the notebook and may ask you if you are a robot (these instructions assume you are not).

Running:

```bash
!nvidia-smi
```

in a cell will verify this has worked and show you what kind of hardware you have access to.

#### Data

Some notebooks will require additional data.
Each user is responsible for checking the content of datasets and the applicable licenses and determining if suitable for the intended use.
