# SMRD

This repository implements two papers for diffusion model based MRI reconstruction:

SURE-Based Robust MRI Reconstruction with Diffusion Models (SMRD). MICCAI 2023 (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43898-1_20)

It show cases how the conjugate gradient method can be used to enforece meausrement consistency in diffusion model based MRI reconstruction; it also shows
how the SURE-based method can be used to perform early stopping, so less iteratios and artifacts are introduced during the generation of the reconstructured image.
