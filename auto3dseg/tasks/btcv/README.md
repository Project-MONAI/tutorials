# BTCV Dataset For Auto3dseg

This repository provides a benmarking guide and recipe to train the template algorithms, validation performance, and is tested and maintained by NVIDIA.


## Task Overview

For BTCV dataset, under Institutional Review Board (IRB) supervision, 50 abdomen CT scans of were randomly selected from a combination of an ongoing colorectal cancer chemotherapy trial, and a retrospective ventral hernia study. The 50 scans were captured during portal venous contrast phase with variable volume sizes (512 x 512 x 85 - 512 x 512 x 198) and field of views (approx. 280 x 280 x 280 mm3 - 500 x 500 x 650 mm3). The in-plane resolution varies from 0.54 x 0.54 mm2 to 0.98 x 0.98 mm2, while the slice thickness ranges from 2.5 mm to 5.0 mm. 

- Target: 13 abdominal organs including 
    1. Spleen 
    2. Right Kidney 
    3. Left Kideny 
    4. Gallbladder 
    5. Esophagus 
    6. Liver 
    7. Stomach 
    8. Aorta 
    9. IVC 
    10. Portal and Splenic Veins 
    11. Pancreas 
    12. Right adrenal gland 
    13. Left adrenal gland.
- Modality: CT
- Size: 30 3D volumes (24 Training + 6 Testing)
- Challenge: BTCV MICCAI Challenge

The following figure shows image patches with the organ sub-regions that are annotated in the CT (top left) and the final labels for the whole dataset (right).

The image patches show anatomies of a subject, including: 
1. large organs: spleen, liver, stomach. 
2. Smaller organs: gallbladder, esophagus, kidneys, pancreas. 
3. Vascular tissues: aorta, IVC, P&S Veins. 
4. Glands: left and right adrenal gland

##### Validation performance: NVIDIA DGX-1 (4x V100 32G)

Our results were obtained by running the 
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 scripts/train.py run --config_file configs/algo_config.yaml
```
training script in the MONAI 0.9.1 container on NVIDIA DGX-1 with (4x V100 32G) GPUs. Performance numbers (in volumes per second) were averaged over an entire training epoch.
