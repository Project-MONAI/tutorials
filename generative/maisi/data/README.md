# Medical AI for Synthetic Imaging (MAISI) Data Preparation

Disclaimer: We are not the host of the data. Please make sure to read the requirements and usage policies of the data and give credit to the authors of the dataset!

### 1 VAE training Data
The VAE training dataset used in MAISI contains 37243 CT training data and 1963 CT validation data from chest, abdomen, head and neck region; and 17887 MRI training data and 940 MRI validation data from brain, skul-stripped brain, chest, and below-abdomen region.

### 2 Diffusion model training Data


### 3 ControlNet model training Data

#### 3.1 Example preprocessed dataset

We provide the preprocessed subset of [C4KC-KiTS](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/c4kc-kits/) dataset used in the finetuning config `environment_maisi_controlnet_train.json`. The dataset and coresponding JSON data list can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iMStdYxcl26dEXgJEXOjkWvx-I2fYZ2u?usp=sharing) and should be saved in `maisi/dataset/` folder.

The structure of example folder in the preprocessed dataset is: 
```
            |-*arterial*.nii.gz     # original image
            |-*arterial_emb*.nii.gz     # encoded image embedding
KiTS-000* --|-mask*.nii.gz      # original labels
            |-mask_pseudo_label*.nii.gz     # pseudo labels
            |-mask_combined_label*.nii.gz     # combined mask of original and pseudo labels

```
An example combined mask of original and pseudo labels is shown below:
![example_combined_mask](./example_combined_mask.png)

Please note that the label of Kidney Tumor is mapped to index `129` in this preprocessed dataset. The encoded image embedding is generated by provided `Autoencoder` in `./models/autoencoder_epoch273.pt` during preprocessing to save memeory usage for training. The pseudo labels are generated by [VISTA 3D](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/VISTA). In addition, the dimension of each volume and corresponding pseudo label is resampled to the closest multiple of 128 (e.g., 128, 256, 384, 512, ...).

The training workflow requires one JSON file to specify the image embedding and segmentation pairs. The example file is located in the `maisi/dataset/C4KC-KiTS_subset.json`.

The JSON file has the following structure:
```python
{
    "training": [
        {
            "image": "*/*arterial_emb*.nii.gz",  # relative path to the image embedding file
            "label": "*/mask_combined_label*.nii.gz",  # relative path to the combined label file
            "dim": [512, 512, 512],  # the dimension of image 
            "spacing": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],  # the spacing of image
            "top_region_index": [0, 1, 0, 0],  # the top region index of the image
            "bottom_region_index": [0, 0, 0, 1],  # the bottom region index of the image
            "fold": 0  # fold index for cross validation, fold 0 is used for training
        },

        ...
    ]
}
```

#### 3.2 Controlnet full training datasets
The ControlNet training dataset used in MAISI contains 6330 CT volumes (5058 and 1272 volumes are used for training and validation, respectively) across 20 datasets and covers different body regions and diseases.

The table below summarizes the number of volumes for each dataset.
