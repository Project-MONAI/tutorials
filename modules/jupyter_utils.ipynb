    "# Jupyter Utilities Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "MONAI comes with an expanding set of useful utilities for Jupyter notebooks. This demo notebook illustrates their use with a toy segmentation problem. One challenge of Jupyter notebooks is the connection between the browser window and a running cell. Later versions have improved behaviour but there still is a loss of output from running cells if the browser window is closed. Furthermore, while a cell is running no other calls can run, so running code to inspect the training process mid-run isn't possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "MONAI's solution is to provide a convenient method for wrapping Ignite `Engine`-derived classes in a thread so that training can happen asynchronously from the notebook's main thread. This allows cells to complete immediately but allow training to continue in the background. Output to stdout/stderr is still (mostly) captured by that cell or whichever cell is subsequently run, but also allows the browser window to be closed or other cells to be run. The wrapper, `ThreadContainer` provides some methods for inspecting the status of the run and plotting some simple outputs. This is particularly useful if you cannot or simply don't want to use external tools like Tensorboard to monitor your progress."
