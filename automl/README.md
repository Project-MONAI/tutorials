# AutoML

Nowadays, given the technological advances in the algorithmic design (such as deep learning) and hardware platforms (such as GPU), medical image analysis has become a key step in disease understanding, clinical diagnosis, and treatment planning. The sizes, shapes, and appearances of object-of-interest (e.g., organ, bone, or tumor) in medical images can vary greatly across different anatomical structures. These semantic features are closely related to the severity of the disease. At the same time, variations in the imaging patterns related to pathologies, scanning protocols, and medical devices introduce a computational challenge for automated algorithms. Therefore, automated processing (such segmentation) of object-of-interest is one of the most challenging tasks in automated analysis of medical images, such as 3D CT, 3D MRI, histopathology, etc. When facing with such challenges, most machine/deep learning models struggle to provide comprehensive solutions.
