    "# UNet++ input size constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "MONAI provides an enhanced version of UNet (``monai.networks.nets.UNet ``), which not only supports residual units, but also can use more hyperparameters (like ``strides``, ``kernel_size`` and ``up_kernel_size``) than ``monai.networks.nets.BasicUNet``. However, ``UNet`` has some constraints for both network hyperparameters and sizes of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "MONAI provides a version of UNET++ (`` monai.networks.nets.BasicUnetPlusPlus ``), with fixed num. of down-scale layer, strides of 2. The configurations you can change are: the number input and output channels, number of hidden channels (6 different layers), norm and activation, bias of convolution, dropout rate, and up-sampling model. As `UNET`, different model configurations can affect the input shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints of hyper-parameters can be found in the docstring of the network, and this tutorial is focused on how to determine a reasonable input size."
