    "This notebook demonstrates downloading the [Prostate mri anatomy](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/releases/download/hosting_storage_v1/prostate_mri_anatomy_v0.3.1.zip) model from MONAI's Model Zoo and applying it to segment a subset of data from the [SPIE-AAPM-NCI PROSTATEx Challenges (PROSTATEx) collection](https://doi.org/10.7937/K9TCIA.2017.MURS5CL10.7937/TCIA.X0H0-1706) on [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/).  The resulting data are then visualized using [itkWidgets].(https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets)\n",
    "\n",
    "Features demonstrated include:\n",
    "* Using a python script to download and load a model from MONAI's Model Zoo into python.\n",
    "* Downloading and preparing data from TCIA for processing using that model.\n",
    "* Applying the model to the TCIA data.\n",
    "* Visually comparing model results with expert segmentation results available on TCIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "[MONAI's Model Zoo](https://monai.io/model-zoo.html) provides pre-trained AI deep learning models that can be downloaded and used to process new data or as a starting point for transfer learning.  The [Prostate mri anatomy](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo/releases/download/hosting_storage_v1/prostate_mri_anatomy_v0.3.1.zip) model was trained with the UNet architecture and is used for 3D volumetric segmentation of the anatomical prostate zones on T2w MRI images. The segmentation of the anatomical regions is formulated as a voxel-wise classification. Each voxel is classified as either central gland (1), peripheral zone (2), or background (0). The model is optimized using a gradient descent method that minimizes the focal soft-dice loss between the predicted mask and the actual segmentation. The model was trained in the prostate158 training data, which is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6481141. Only T2w images were used for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is a public service funded by the National Cancer Institute that addresses this challenge by providing hosting and de-identification services to take major burdens of data sharing off researchers. Its rich collection of clinical data and annotations is particularly powerful as a community resource when it is paired with interactive code systems, such as Jupyter systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "[itkWidgets](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets) allows researchers to visualize images, point sets, and 3D geometry in Jupyter systems (Jupyer Notebooks, JupyterLab, AWS SageMaker, and Google Colab). Despite its name, itkWidgets does not require the use of ITK. It can directly visualize numpy arrays, torch tensors, DASK arrays, VTK polydata, and a multitude of other python data structures."
