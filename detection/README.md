### 1. Data

The dataset we are experimenting in this example is LUNA16 (https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Home/).
LUNA16 is a public dataset of CT lung nodule detection. Using raw CT scans, the goal is to identify locations of possible nodules, and to assign a probability for being a nodule to each location.

Disclaimer: We are not the host of the data. Please make sure to read the requirements and usage policies of the data and give credit to the authors of the dataset!

We follow the official 10-fold data splitting from LUNA16 challenge and generate data split json files using the script from [nnDetection](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection/blob/main/projects/Task016_Luna/scripts/prepare.py).
The resulted json files can be downloaded from https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI-extra-test-data/releases/download/0.8.1/LUNA16_datasplit-20220615T233840Z-001.zip.
In these files, the values of "box" are the ground truth boxes in world coordinate.

### 3. Run the example
#### [3.1 Prepare Your Data](./luna16_prepare_images.py)

The raw CT images in LUNA16 have various of voxel sizes. The first step is to resample them to the same voxel size, which is defined in the value of "spacing" in [./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json](./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json).

Then, please open [luna16_prepare_env_files.py](luna16_prepare_env_files.py), change the value of "raw_data_base_dir" to the directory where you store the downloaded images, the value of "downloaded_datasplit_dir" to where you downloaded the data split json files, and the value of "resampled_data_base_dir" to the target directory where you will save the resampled images.

Finally, resample the images by running
```bash
python3 luna16_prepare_env_files.py
python3 luna16_prepare_images.py -c ./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json
```

The original images are with mhd/raw format, the resampled images will be with Nifti format.

#### [3.2 3D Detection Training](./luna16_training.py)

The LUNA16 dataset was splitted into 10-fold to run cross-fold training and inference.

Taking fold 0 as an example, run:
```bash
python3 luna16_training.py \
    -e ./config/environment_luna16_fold0.json \
    -c ./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json
```

This python script uses batch size and patch size defined in [./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json](./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json), which works for a 16G GPU.
If you have a different GPU memory size, please change "batch_size", "patch_size", and "val_patch_size" to fit the GPU you use.

For fold i, please run
```bash
python3 luna16_training.py \
    -e ./config/environment_luna16_fold${i}.json \
    -c ./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json
```

For each fold, 95% of the training data is used for training, while the rest 5% is used for validation and model selection.
The training and validation curves for 300 epochs of 10 folds are shown as below. The upper row shows the training losses for box regression and classification. The bottom row shows the validation mAP and mAR for IoU ranging from 0.1 to 0.5.

</p>

With a single DGX1V 16G GPU, it took around 55 hours to train 300 epochs for each data fold.

#### [3.3 3D Detection Inference](./luna16_testing.py)

If you have a different GPU memory size than 16G, please maximize "val_patch_size" in [./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json](./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json) to fit the GPU you use.

For fold i, please run
```bash
python3 luna16_testing.py \
    -e ./config/environment_luna16_fold${i}.json \
    -c ./config/config_train_luna16_16g.json
```

#### [3.4 LUNA16 Detection Evaluation](./run_luna16_offical_eval.sh)
Please download the official LUNA16 evaluation scripts from https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/Evaluation/,
and save it as ./evaluation_luna16

./evaluation_luna16/noduleCADEvaluationLUNA16.py will be the main python script to generate evaluation scores.

To run evaluation, please first make sure the 10 resulted json files result_luna16_fold{i}.json are in ./result folder.
Then run:
```bash
./run_luna16_offical_eval.sh
```

This bash script first combines the 10 result json files from 10 folds into one csv file,
then runs the official LUNA16 evaluation scripts saved in ./evaluation_luna16.

The evaluation scores will be stored in ./result/eval_luna16_scores

We got FROC result as shown in the table below. It is comparable with the result in [nnDetection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00817.pdf) Table 2.

#### 3.5 Comparison to nnDetection
This MONAI example uses similar training and inference workflows as [nnDetection](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnDetection) LUNA16, with same hyper-parameters and data augmentation pipeline.

The major differences are as follows:
1) We use a different learning rate scheduler than nnDetection.
2) We train 300 epochs (around 150k iterations), while nnDetection trains 125k iterations.
3) During training, we run validation with 5% of the training data and save the best model, while nnDetection directly saves the model from the last iteration for inference.
4) When input image is too large to fit in the GPU memory, inference is performed on patches. We do sliding window aggregation on the predicted class logits and box regression, while nnDetection uses a different aggregation stategy from [Jaeger et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v116/jaeger20a/jaeger20a.pdf).


There are other differences that may have minor impact on the performance:
1) We use different network architecture. We use [RetinaNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) with ResNet as backbone, while nnDetection uses [RetinaUnet](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v116/jaeger20a/jaeger20a.pdf) with U-net as backbone.
2) We directly apply the trained model to the images/patches during inference, while nnDetection uses mirror aggregation by applying the trained model to the images/patches flipped in three axes and averaging the flipped-back results.
3) We read in boxes from data loader and do data augmentation on boxes. nnDetection, on the other hand, reads in image masks with ellipsoid as foreground and do data augmentation on masks, then convert the masks to boxes to train the network.
