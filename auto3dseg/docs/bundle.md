## Algorithm Bundle

<<<<<<< HEAD
We provide four default algorithms (DiNTS, 2D/3D SegResNet, SwinUNETR) as baseline algorithms of **Auto3DSeg**. Each algorithm includes adavanced network architectures and well-tuned model training recipes. And the algorithms are formulated in the MONAI package format, with an independent folder structure, providing the necessary functions for model training, verification, and inference. The details of MONAI bundle can be found in the following [link](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/mb_specification.html).
