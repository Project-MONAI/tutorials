# Self-Supervised Pre-training Tutorial

This directory contains two scripts. The first script 'ssl_script_train.py' generates
a good set of pre-trained weights using unlabeled data with self-supervised tasks that
are based on augmentations of different types. The second script 'ssl_finetune_train.py' uses
the pre-trained weights generated from the first script and performs fine-tuning on a fully supervised
task.

In case, the user wants to skip the pre-training part, the pre-trained weights can be
[downloaded from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0BouIiQ9oLizubOIH9Rlpad5Kk_2RtY/view?usp=sharing)
to use for fine-tuning tasks and directly skip to the second part of the tutorial which is using the
'ssl_finetune_train.py'.

### Steps to run the tutorial
1.) Download the two datasets [TCIA-Covid19](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CT+Images+in+COVID-19)
& [BTCV](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789) (More detail about them in the Data section)\
2.) Modify the paths for data_root, json_path & logdir in ssl_script_train.py\
3.) Run the 'ssl_script_train.py'\
4.) Modify the paths for data_root, json_path, pre-trained_weights_path from 2.) and
logdir_path in 'ssl_finetuning_train.py'\
5.) Run the 'ssl_finetuning_script.py'\
6.) And that's all folks, use the model to your needs

### 1.Data
Pre-training Dataset: The TCIA Covid-19 dataset was used for generating the
[pre-trained weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D7G1FhgZfBhql4djMfiSy0xODVXnLlpd/view?usp=sharing).
The dataset contains a total of 771 3D CT Volumes. The volumes were split into training and validation sets
of 600 and 171 3D volumes correspondingly. The data is available for download at this
[link](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CT+Images+in+COVID-19).
If this dataset is being used in your work,  please use [1] as reference. A json file is provided
which contains the training and validation splits that were used for the training. The json file can be found in the
json_files directory of the self-supervised training tutorial.

Fine-tuning Dataset: The dataset from Beyond the Cranial Vault Challenge
[(BTCV)](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217789)
2015 hosted at MICCAI, was used as a fully supervised fine-tuning task on the pre-trained weights. The dataset
consists of 30 3D Volumes with annotated labels of up to 13 different organs [2]. There are 3 json files provided in the
json_files directory for the dataset. They correspond to having different number of training volumes ranging from
6, 12 and 24. All 3 json files have the same validation split.

### 2. Network Architectures

For pre-training a modified version of ViT [1] has been used, it can be referred
[here](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/networks.html#vitautoenc)
from MONAI. The original ViT was modified by attachment of two 3D Convolutional Transpose Layers to achieve a similar
reconstruction size as that of the input image. The ViT is the backbone for the UNETR [2] network architecture which
was used for the fine-tuning fully supervised tasks.

The pre-trained backbone of ViT weights were loaded to UNETR and the decoder head still relies on random initialization
for adaptability of the new downstream task. This flexibility also allows the user to adapt the ViT backbone to their
own custom created network architectures as well.

### 3. Self-supervised Tasks

The pre-training pipeline has two aspects to it (Refer figure shown below). First, it uses augmentation (top row) to
mutate the data and second, it utilizes regularized
[contrastive loss](https://docs.monai.io/en/latest/losses.html#contrastiveloss) [3] to learn feature representations
of the unlabeled data. The multiple augmentations are applied on a randomly selected 3D foreground patch from a 3D
volume. Two augmented views of the same 3D patch are generated for the contrastive loss as it functions by drawing
the two augmented views closer to each other if the views are generated from the same patch, if not then it tries to
maximize the disagreement. The CL offers this functionality on a mini-batch.

![image](../figures/SSL_Overview_Figure.png)

The augmentations mutate the 3D patch in various ways, the primary task of the network is to reconstruct
the original image. The different augmentations used are classical techniques such as in-painting [1], out-painting [1]
and noise augmentation to the image by local pixel shuffling [2]. The secondary task of the network is to simultaneously
reconstruct the two augmented views as similar to each other as possible via regularized contrastive loss [3] as its
objective is to maximize the agreement. The term regularized has been used here because contrastive loss is adjusted
by the reconstruction loss as a dynamic weight itself.

The below example image depicts the usage of the augmentation pipeline where two augmented views are drawn of the same
3D patch:

![image](../figures/SSL_Different_Augviews.png)

Multiple axial slices of a 96x96x96 patch are shown before the augmentation (Ref Original Patch in the above figure).
Augmented View 1 & 2 are different augmentations generated via the transforms on the same cubic patch. The objective
of the SSL network is to reconstruct the original top row image from the first view. The contrastive loss
is driven by maximizing agreement of the reconstruction based on input of the two augmented views.
`matshow3d` from `monai.visualize` was used for creating this figure, a tutorial for using can be found [here](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/modules/transform_visualization.ipynb)
