# MONAI Example:  Implementing 2D Classification Model with MedNIST Dataset Using FEDn

This example provides a step-by-step guide to deploying and running a 2D classification model using the MedNIST dataset in a federated environment with the [FEDn framework](https://www.scaleoutsystems.com/framework) developed by [Scaleout Systems](https://www.scaleoutsystems.com/). This example builds on the centralized [example](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/main/2d_classification/mednist_tutorial.ipynb) from the MONAI project and adapts it for federated learning settings, utilizing the same code for ease of transition.

The FEDn framework supports researchers with its robust [open-source SDK](https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) and a [public SaaS platform](https://fedn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/studio.html), enabling scalable and efficient federated learning use cases.
