from monai.apps.auto3dseg import AutoRunner

# the minimum required code is to create an AutoRunner() and call runner.run()
# the algos must be set to 'segresnet' (since currently it's the only algo with support of multi-resolution input images, such as CT and PET)
# here we also set ensemble=False (optional) to prevent inference on the testing set (since we do not use any testing sets, only the 5-fold cross validation)
# for you own inference (and ensemble) you can provide a list of testing files in "hecktor22_folds.json"
runner = AutoRunner(input="input.yaml", algos="segresnet", work_dir="./work_dir", ensemble=False)

## optionally, we can use just 1-fold (for a quick training of a single model, instead of training 5 folds)
# runner.set_num_fold(1)

## optionally, we can define the path to the dataset here, instead of the one in input.yaml
# runner.set_training_params({"dataroot" : '/data/hecktor22'})

runner.run()
