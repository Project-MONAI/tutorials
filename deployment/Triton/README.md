Deploying MONAI Code via Triton Python Backend
================================================

Simple demo to introduce a standard way for model developers to incorporate Python based projects in a standard way. 
In addition, this code will demonstrate how Users/Developers can easily deploy MONAI inference code for field testing.
Finally, the code will demonstrate a method to do low latency classification and validation inference with Triton.

The steps below describe how to set-up a model repository, pull the Triton container, launch the Triton inference server, and then send inference requests to the running server.

This demo and description borrows heavily from the [Triton Python Backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/python_backend) repo. The demo assumes you have at least one GPU 

Get The Demo Source Code
-------------------------------
Pull down the demo repository and start with the [Quick Start] (#quick-start) guide.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials.git
```
# Python Backend 

The Triton backend for Python. The goal of Python backend is to let you serve
models written in Python by Triton Inference Server without having to write
any C++ code. We will use this to demonstrate implementing MONAI code inside Triton.

## User Documentation

* [Quick Start](#quick-start)
* [Examples](#examples)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Model Config File](#model-config-file)
* [Error Hanldling](#error-handling)


## Quick Start

1. Build Triton Container Image and Copy Model repository files using shell script

```
$ ./triton_build.sh
```
2. Run Triton Container Image in Background Terminal using provided shell script
The supplied script will start the demo container with Triton and expose the three ports to localhost needed for the application to send inference requests. 
```
$ ./triton_run_local.sh
```
3. Install environment for client
The client environment should have Python 3 installed and should have the necessary packages installed. 
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Other dependent libraries for the Python Triton client are available as a Python packages
```
$ pip install nvidia-pyindex
$ pip install tritonclient[all]
```
5. Run the client program
The [client](./client/client.py) program will take an optional file input and perform  classification to determine whether the study shows COVID-19 or not COVID-19.  See the [NVIDIA COVID-19 Classification ](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/models/nvidia:med:clara_pt_covid19_3d_ct_classification) example in NGC for more background. 
```
$ python -u client/client.py [filename/directory]
```
and the program returns
``` Default input for the client is client/test_data/prostate_24.nii.gz
$ Classification result: ['Prostate segmented']
```
## Examples:
The example demonstrates running a Triton Python Backend on a single image classification problem.  
1. First, a Dockerfile and build script is used to build a container to Run the Triton Service and copy the model specific files in the container. 
```Dockerfile:
# use desired Triton container as base image for our app
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:21.04-py3

# create model directory in container
RUN mkdir -p /models/monai_covid/1

# install project-specific dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN rm requirements.txt

# copy contents of model project into model repo in container image
COPY models/monai_covid/config.pbtxt /models/monai_covid
COPY models/monai_covid/1/model.py /models/monai_covid/1


ENTRYPOINT [ "tritonserver", "--model-repository=/models"]
```
Note: The Triton service expects a certain directory structure discussed in [Model Config File](#model-config-file) to load the model definitions.

2. Next, the container with the Triton Service runs as a service (in background or separate terminal for demo).  In this example, the ports used by the Triton Service are set to `8000` for client communications.
```Dockerfile:
demo_app_image_name="monai_triton:demo"
docker run --shm-size=128G --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 -p 127.0.0.1:8090:8002 ${demo_app_image_name}
```
3. See [Model Config File](#model-config-file) to see the expected file structure for Triton.
- Modify the models/monai_prostrate/1/model.py file to satisfy any model configuration requirements while keeping the required components in the model definition. See the * [Usage](#usage) section for background. 
- In the models/monai_prostrate/1/config.pbtxt file configure the number of GPUs and which ones are used.
e.g. Using two available GPUs and two parallel versions of the model per GPU
```
instance_group [
  { 
    kind: KIND_GPU
    count: 2
    gpus: [ 0, 1 ]
  }
```
e.g. Using three of four available GPUs and four parallel versions of the model per GPU
```
instance_group [
  { 
    kind: KIND_GPU
    count: 4
    gpus: [ 0, 1, 3 ]
  }
```
Also, other configurations like dynamic batching and corresponding sizes can be configured. See the [Triton Service Documentation model configurations](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server/blob/main/docs/model_configuration.md) documentation for more information.
 
- Finally, be sure to include Tensors or Torchscript definition *.ts files in the directory structure. In this example, a COVID19 classificatiion model based in PyTorch is used. 
```
covid19_model.ts
```
The Dockerfile will copy the model definition structure into the Triton container Service.  When the container is run, the python backend implementation will pull the covid19_model.ts file from a Google Drive for the demo.  So the container should be rebuilt after any modifications to the GPU configuration or model configurations for the example.

4. A Python [client](./client/client.py) program configures the model and makes an http request to Triton as a Service. Note: Triton supports other interfaces like gRPC.
The client reads an input image converted from Nifti to a byte array for classification. 

- In this example, a model trained to detect COVID-19 is provided an image with COVID or without.    
```python:
filename = 'client/test_data/volume-covid19-A-0000.nii.gz'
```
- The client calls the Triton Service using the external port configured previously.
```python:
with httpclient.InferenceServerClient("localhost:8000") as client:
```
- The Triton inference response is returned :
```python:
response = client.infer(model_name,
    inputs,
    request_id=str(uuid4().hex),
    outputs=outputs,)

result = response.get_response()
```
