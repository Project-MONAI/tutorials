# nnU-Net Integration

[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) is an open-source deep learning framework that has been specifically designed for medical image segmentation. Medical image segmentation is a challenging task that involves the identification and separation of different structures or regions of interest within an image. Accurate segmentation of medical images is critical for many applications, including diagnosis, treatment planning, and image-guided interventions.

Traditional methods for medical image segmentation require significant manual intervention and often lack accuracy and consistency. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential in achieving accurate and efficient medical image segmentation.

nnU-Net is a state-of-the-art deep learning framework that is tailored for medical image segmentation. It builds upon the popular U-Net architecture and incorporates various advanced features and improvements, such as cascaded networks, novel loss functions, and pre-processing steps. nnU-Net also provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to train and evaluate their segmentation models quickly.

nnU-Net has been widely used in various medical imaging applications, including brain segmentation, liver segmentation, and prostate segmentation, among others. The framework has consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance in various benchmark datasets and challenges, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for advancing medical image analysis.
