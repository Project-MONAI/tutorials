# Active Learning Simulation Tutorial For Surgical Tool Segmentation

Write an active learning description here

### Steps to run the tutorial
1. Download the data from **put the dataset link here**
2. To just launch the active learning script with 'variance' acquisition function, launch the code with the below command: `python active_learning.py --list_all_arguments here`
3. For executing the active learning acquisition functions and the full baseline, execute the `runner.sh`
4. To interpret results, launch jupyter notebook `results_uncertainty.ipynb`

### 1. Data

**Write what you know about the dataset here don't forget to use references**

### 2. Active Learning Hyper-parameters

**Write all the active learning hyper params here**

### 3. Training Hyper-parameters

**Write all the active learning hyper params here**

### 4. Results & Discussion

**Plot some uncertainty figures and show the main result**
